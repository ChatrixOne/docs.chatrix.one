## Data Privacy

As an operator of service representing an alternative to the available methods of Internet communication, I strive to:

- Minimum data;
- Protection of personal data.

## Things to keep in mind

- **IP** addresses of users are **not** recorded by default. Exceptions are cases when an attempt to illegally access the system is detected. In such situations, the **IP** address is recorded to prevent attacks against the respective profile or profiles;
- Personal data is **not** required for registration. This unfortunately complicates proving account ownership in cases where the password needs to be reset or changed by an administrator;

!!! tip "Tip"

     Use password management software (**Password Manager**). I would recommend [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/).

- Your account identifier (**Jabber ID**) is only shared with **XMPP** users with whom you interact;
- Your contact list (**roster, chatroom bookmarks**) is not shared with other parties (participants in **XMPP** communication) unless you give express permission;
- Your availability (presence) information is stored in memory and automatically shared with your contacts and the chat rooms you enter;
- Date and time of last login from an account is stored to identify inactive accounts.
- In order to maintain synchronization of messages between several devices and to exchange messages even when two subscribers are not online at the same time, messages are stored on the server for a period of up to 4 weeks. This feature is called **MAM** (**M**essage **A**rchive **M**anagement) and is enabled by default, both for individual calls and **MUC** (**M**ulti **U**ser **C**hats) also known as **Chatrooms** to offer a commercial messenger-like user experience, especially to inexperienced **XMPP** users. For your own security, you can use **OMEMO** (end-to-end encryption) to keep your conversations safe even if my server's security systems become compromised. If you do not want your data to be stored on the server, see the section [Frequently Asked Questions](https://docs.chatrix.one/en/faq/) and specifically the part [How do I turn off message archiving?](https://docs.chatrix.one/en/faq/#how-do-i-turn-off-message-archiving);

- Content uploaded via `http_upload` (photos and other files) remains stored on the server for 4 weeks;

!!! info "Information"

     If you use **OMEMO**, pictures and other files cannot be read. For more information, see [What would a photo stored on the server in encrypted form look like?](https://docs.chatrix.one/en/faq/#what-would-a-photo-that-is-stored-on-the-server-in-encrypted-form-look-like)

- If I am required to cooperate with authorities under applicable law, the information will be disclosed in accordance with applicable law.

## View stored data

- **IP** address of newly registered customer - for one hour in order to limit the number of registrations;
- **IP** addresses of incorrect access attempts - up to six hours;
- Message history - four weeks, but you can disable from your application (software) settings. For more information, see [How do I turn off message archiving?](https://docs.chatrix.one/en/faq/#how-do-i-turn-off-message-archiving);
- Time of the last login to the system (to detect inactive users);
- Profile information and avatar;
- Contacts and **MUC** added to profile;
- Offline messages - deleted as soon as they are delivered to the user;
- Uploaded files - four weeks in anonymized form.

!!! tip "Tip"

     You can protect your private messages by enabling **OMEMO** end-to-end encryption.

## Correction and deletion

Using an **XMPP** service-compatible client, after logging into your profile, you have the option to change and delete the following information:

- List of contacts and bookmarks in chat room;
- **vCard** and avatar;
- Offline messages;
- Message archives.

You can delete your personal profile at any time from the [**Delete Profile**](https://chatrix.one/user/delete/) page. Instructions for filling in the fields are available in the [**Unregister Account**](https://docs.chatrix.one/en/account/delete-account/) section.

!!! danger "Warning!"

     The action of deleting a profile is **irreversible**! There is no built-in undo mechanism. After pressing the ++"Unregister"++ button, the action is performed instantly, without the need for additional confirmation.

For all other types of personal data stored by **Chatrix.One** please contact the representative posted in the [**Contacts**](https://docs.chatrix.one/en/about/#contacts) section.

To obtain information about the data processed and stored by other **XMPP** servers with which you have interacted, it is necessary to contact their respective representative.
