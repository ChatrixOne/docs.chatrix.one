## New Registrations Are Closed!

Dear users,

Currently, new registrations for the **XMPP** service provided by **Chatrix.One** are temporarily suspended. This is due to reaching the maximum storage capacity. Unfortunately, this is the only way we can guarantee quality service to our current users.

We are working on removing the limitation, but we cannot commit to a time frame for implementation. Please check periodically the [**Status**](https://docs.chatrix.one/en/status/#account-registrations) page for updates on the possibility of new registrations. Until then, feel free to register an account on one of the many free and publicly available [**XMPP** servers](https://docs.chatrix.one/en/faq/#lists-of-free-xmpp-servers).

Thank you for your patience and understanding.

With best wishes, **Chatrix.One**.
