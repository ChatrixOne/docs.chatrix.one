In general, I am far from the thought of imposing any restrictions. However, practice has shown that in order for a community to exist and function, the presence and observance of certain rules is mandatory. The **XMPP** service offered by **Chatrix.One** is no exception. Precisely for this reason, I recommend that you familiarize yourself with the rules that **every** user, moderator or administrator must follow.

- For persons under 16 years of age, registration must be done with the consent of a parent or guardian.
