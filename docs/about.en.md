# About Me

Over the years, the service has migrated multiple times across different hardware. The aim has always been minimal power consumption and maximum service stability.

| Year | Event | Hardware | Platform |
|:--------------|:-----------------|:------------ ------------|:----------|
|2015 | Beginning | Raspberry Pi 3 | Prosody |
|2016 | First upgrade | Odroid C2 | Prosody |
|2018 | Second Upgrade | Intel NUC 7P | Prosody |
|2019 | Third upgrade | Asus VIVO UN68U | Prosody |
|2020 | Fourth Upgrade | Supermicro E301-9D-8CN4 | Prosody |
|2022 | Fifth Upgrade | Oracle Cloud | Ejabberd |

In the period 2015 - 2018, due to hardware limitations, the service was used as a test platform only in a local network. Another reason is the lack at that time of mature and full-fledged software for implementing **XMPP** communication.

After the transition from **ARM** to **x86** architecture in 2018, **Chatrix.One** becomes publicly available. Thanks to the **Conversations** project, the **OMEMO** encryption method appears, and **XMPP** undergoes numerous improvements.

The most significant transition to date took place in 2022, when the service migrated from **Prosody** to **Ejabberd** in a cloud virtual private server located in **ORACLE**'s Swiss Data Center. The result is significantly higher reliability and service continuity.
