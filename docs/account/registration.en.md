Personal data is **not** required to register an account in **Chatrix.One**. You do not need to provide a phone number, credit/debit card details, photo or address. It is enough to choose one of the methods listed below, according to your personal preferences.

## Ways to register an account

- :material-qrcode-scan: - Scan an invitation in the form of QR code;
- :material-link-variant: - Open an invitation in the form of URL address;
- :material-pencil: - Independently, by filling out the online [registration form](https://docs.chatrix.one/en/account/registration-form/);
- :material-apps: - Through your installed application - client;
- :material-email-check: - By sending an email to the address in the contacts field at the bottom of this website. Contacts are also available in the [About Me](https://docs.chatrix.one/en/about/) section. If you are using a mobile device, please check the menu :material-menu:;
- :material-message-check: - By sending an XMPP message to an administrator. An active XMPP account is required, and the server you are sending from is irrelevant. For an up-to-date administrator address, please see the [About Me](https://docs.chatrix.one/en/about/#contacts) section;
- :material-phone-check: - A phone call, if you have a phone number to contact an administrator. It will not be published on the website;
- :material-eye-check-outline: - A face-to-face meeting.


!!! warning "Important"

     As of February 1, 2026, profile registration will be exclusively available by invitation, delivered as a URL link or QR code.

!!! failure "Important"

     Currently, profile registration via the registration form and applications is **suspended**! This is done to protect the service from Bots and malicious users creating multiple invalid spam profiles. The preferred method of registration is by using invitations.

Registration by invitation is the preferred way to register a **Chatrix.One** account. In this way, you will be able to choose the username yourself. The password will be generated automatically, and of course you can edit it. In case the password field is empty, you will have to fill it manually. To receive an invitation, you need to contact an administrator.

When contacting me by email, using a temporary email service of the type [**10 Minute mail**](https://10minutemail.com/) or [**Temp Mail**](https://temp-mail.org/), keep in mind that I cannot always respond immediately. For this reason, it would be more practical to use a real email address. It will not be stored in a database, nor will it be used for advertising campaigns or any other purposes. **Chatrix.One does not** sell or **does not** provide information to third parties! You will only receive an email with a password for the username you have chosen.

!!! info "Information"

     In case the username you have chosen is taken, you will receive additional emails to notify you about the situation.

After a successful initial login to the system, I recommend that you change the automatically generated password to one of your choice. Please be wise in your choice. Passwords like `123abc`, `1234567890`, `P@ssword123` and similar are cracked in **seconds** and are a sure way to become a victim of hackers and lose your account.

!!! tip "Tip"

     Avoid using one password for everything! Use a password managing software (Password Manager). This way, you will be able to easily generate different passwords for each account or application. The most important thing is that you will not need to remember them. I would recommend [**Bitwarden**](https://bitwarden.com/).
     Create easy to remember, but hard to crack passwords. For example: `1Favorite-Phrase-From-A-Favorite-Poem` or `Keep-Expectations-2Low`. Avoid hard to remember, but easy to crack passwords! For example: `Sq@-!@#!`. Such a password is cracked in **minutes** or **hours**!

To test the security of your password, online tools such as [**How ​​Secure Is My Password?**](https://www.security.org/how-secure-is-my-password/) and [**Have i been pwned?**](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) are available. They are useful in case you want to find out how long it will take for your chosen password to be cracked, as well as to check whether it has already been compromised in a previous hacker attack.

!!! info "Information"

     After successful registration, you will receive a system message welcoming you to the **Chatrix.One** server. In cases where there is a suspicion that the account is of the **Bot** type, you will receive a new system message prompting you to answer a question. This is done to protect the service.

## Example templates for invitation requests

To get registered in **Chatrix.One**, you do not have to use any of the listed templates. It is enough to send a free text request to the administrator. The important thing is to write the reason why you want to register on this server. For your convenience, two templates are available. One for email and one for XMPP messages.

!!! example "Example"

    === "Email"

        * **To:** admin[@]chatrix.one
        * **Subject:** Request for Invitation
        * **Message:**

        ```
        Hello,
        
        I would like to request an invitation to register an account on Chatrix.One, as public registration through the website and applications is currently not available.
        I am interested in joining this server because:
        [Briefly describe your reason here]
        I understand that if I would like my username to be included in a Shared Roster Group, I will need to contact an administrator via XMPP message after registration.

        Thank you for your time and consideration.
        
        Best regards,
        
        [Your Name]
        ```

    === "**XMPP** messages"

        * **To:** admin[@]chatrix.one
        * **Messages:**

        ```
        Hello!
        ```

        ```
        I would like to register my [friend/acquaintance/relative/colleague] in Chatrix.One.
        ```
        
        ```
        Could you please send me an invitation for registration?
        ```

        ```
        Thank you.
        ```

If you already have an account, the next step is to install the [required software (client)](https://docs.chatrix.one/en/clients//) for communication.
