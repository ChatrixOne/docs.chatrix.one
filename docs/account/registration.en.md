</figure>

Personal data is **not** required to register a **Chatrix.One** account. You don't need to provide a phone number, credit card details or address. If you choose to register by email using a temporary email service such as [10 Minute mail](https://10minutemail.com/) or [Temp Mail](https://temp-mail.org/), please note that I may not always be able to respond to the moment. For this very reason, it would be more practical to use a real email address. It will not be stored in a database, nor will it be used for advertising campaigns or any other purpose. **Chatrix.One** **does not** sell and **does not** provide information to third parties! You will only receive an email with a password for the username you have chosen.

!!! info "Information"

     In the event that your chosen username is taken, you will receive additional emails to notify you of this.

After a successful initial login to the system, I recommend that you change the automatically generated password to one of your choice. Please be judicious in your choices. Passwords like `123abc`, `1234567890`, `P@ssword123` and similar are cracked in **seconds** and are a surefire way to become a victim of hackers and lose your account.

!!! tip "Tip"

     Create passwords that are easy to remember but hard to crack.
     For example: `2Favorite-Phrases-From-Favorite-Verse` or `Keep-Expectations-2Low`.
     Avoid hard to remember but easy to crack passwords!
     For example: `Sq@-!@#!`. Such a password is cracked in **minutes** or **hours**!

To test the strength of your password, you can use online tools such as [How Secure Is My Password?](https://www.security.org/how-secure-is-my-password/) and [ Have i been pwned?](https://haveibeenpwned.com/). They are useful in case you want to find out how long does it take for your chosen password to be cracked, as well as to check if it has already been compromised in a previous password breach.

!!! tip "Tip"

     Avoid using one password for everything!
     Use password management software (**Password Manager**). This way, you will be able to easily generate different passwords for each account or application. Most importantly, you won't need to remember them. I would recommend [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/).

## Ways to register an account

- :material-pencil: - On your own by completing the online [registration form](https://docs.chatrix.one/en/account/registration-form/);
- :material-apps: - Through your installed application - client;
- :material-email-check: - By sending an email to the address located at the the bottom of this website. Contacts are also available in the [About](https://docs.chatrix.one/en/about/#contacts) section. If you are using a mobile device, please check the menu :material-menu:;
- :material-message-check: - By sending an **XMPP** message to an administrator. An active **XMPP** profile is required, the server you send from is irrelevant. For an up-to-date admin address, please see the [About](https://docs.chatrix.one/en/about/#contacts) section;
- :material-phone-check: - Phone call if you have a phone number to contact an administrator. It will not be published on the website;
- :material-eye-check-outline: - Meets eye to eye.

<!-- !!! failure "Important"

     At the moment, account registration, through the registration form and applications, is temporarily **suspended**! This is done in order to protect the service from bots and unscrupulous users creating multiple invalid spam profiles, which negatively affects the overall user experience. -->

!!! info "Information"

     After successful registration, you will receive a system message to welcome you to the **Chatrix.One** server.
     In cases where the account is suspected to be a **Bot**, you will see a new system message prompting you to answer a question. This is done to protect the service.

## Example templates when registering an account

To get registration in **Chatrix.One** it is not necessary to use any of the mentioned templates. It is enough to send a request in free text to an administrator. The important thing is to write the username you would like to use and whether you want to be included in a **Shared Roster Group** group. Two templates are available for your convenience. One for email and one for **XMPP** messages.

!!! example "Example"

    === "Email"

         * **To:** admin[@]chatrix.one
         * **Subject:** Registering an account

         I would like to be included in Shared Roster Group: [Group Name]

         Thanks.
         ```

If you already have an account, the next step is to install the [necessary software (client)](https://docs.chatrix.one/en/clients/) for communication.
