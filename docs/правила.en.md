   <figcaption>Rules for using <b>Chatrix.One</b></figcaption>
</figure>

In general, I am far from the thought of imposing any restrictions. However, practice has shown that in order for a community to exist and function, the presence and observance of certain rules is mandatory. The **XMPP** service offered by **Chatrix.One** is no exception. Precisely for this reason, I recommend that you familiarize yourself with the rules that **every** user, moderator or administrator must follow.

## [TL;DR](https://bg.wikipedia.org/wiki/TL;DR)

- Do not exercise unauthorized access;
- Respect other users and be tolerant;
- Do not use the service to organize and carry out illegal activities.

## They are forbidden

- Illegal access to the service;
- Messages containing offensive and obscene phrases, racist or other similar definitions, leading to harassment of other users of the service;
- The publication of advertising articles and materials without the approval of an administrator;
- Sending mass messages of the type [**Spam**](https://bg.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spam);
- Registration of more than one profile for one individual, without permission from an administrator;
- Publication of pornographic content - especially that involving minors[^1];
- Publication of Internet links (links), articles and photo material containing scenes of child pornography and violence[^1];
- Use of the service for organizing and carrying out activities prohibited by law.

## Reporting a violation

In case you wish to report a violation, please send an email or **XMPP** message to an administrator. The report must be accompanied by proof in the form of a screenshot - [**Screenshot**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screenshot), which unequivocally shows the violation you described.
