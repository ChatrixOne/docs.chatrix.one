## Data Privacy

As an operator of service representing an alternative to the available methods of Internet communication, I strive to:

- Minimum data;
- Protection of personal data.

## Things to keep in mind

- **IP** addresses of users are **not** recorded by default. Exceptions are cases when an attempt to illegally access the system is detected. In such situations, the **IP** address is recorded to prevent attacks against the respective profile or profiles.
- Personal data is **not** required for registration. This unfortunately complicates proving account ownership in cases where the password needs to be reset or changed by an administrator.

!!! tip "Tip"

     Use password management software (**Password Manager**). I would recommend [**Bitwarden**](https://bitwarden.com/).

- In order to maintain synchronization of messages between several devices and to exchange messages even when two subscribers are not online at the same time, messages are stored on the server for a period of up to 4 weeks. This feature is called **MAM** (**M**essage **A**rchive **M**anagement) and is enabled by default, both for individual calls and **MUC** (**M**ulti **U**ser **C**hats) also known as **Chatrooms** to offer a commercial messenger-like user experience, especially to inexperienced **XMPP** users. For your own security, you can use **OMEMO** (end-to-end encryption) to keep your conversations safe even if my server's security systems become compromised. If you do not want your data to be stored on the server, see the section [**Frequently Asked Questions**](https://docs.chatrix.one/en/често-задавани-въпроси/) and specifically the part [**How do I turn off message archiving?**](https://docs.chatrix.one/en/често-задавани-въпроси/#how-do-i-turn-off-message-archiving).

- Content uploaded via `http_upload` (photos and other files) remains stored on the server for 4 weeks.

!!! info "Information"

     If you use **OMEMO**, pictures and other files cannot be read. For more information, see [**What would a photo stored on the server in encrypted form look like?**](https://docs.chatrix.one/en/често-задавани-въпроси/#what-would-a-photo-that-is-stored-on-the-server-in-encrypted-form-look-like)

- If I am required to cooperate with authorities under applicable law, the information will be disclosed in accordance with applicable law.

## Overview of the stored data

- **IP** addresses: Only for the incorrect access attempts;
- Message history: four weeks, but you can disable from your application (software) settings. For more information, see [**How do I turn off message archiving?**](https://docs.chatrix.one/en/често-задавани-въпроси/#how-do-i-turn-off-message-archiving);
- Time of the last login to the system (to detect inactive users);
- Profile information and avatar;
- Contacts and **MUC** added to profile;
- Uploaded files (four weeks).

!!! tip "Tip"

     You can protect your private messages by enabling **OMEMO** end-to-end encryption.
